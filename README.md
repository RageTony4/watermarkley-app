# Watermarkely

A generative, spatial UI for watermarking images, built with Three.js and GSAP.

## Features

- **Spatial 3D Interface**: Navigate through three distinct scenes in a cinematic 3D environment
- **Biomorphic Particles**: Living, breathing particle system that reacts to mouse movement
- **Interactive Watermarking**: Add text watermarks with real-time preview
- **Smooth Transitions**: GSAP-powered camera movements and scene transitions
- **Immersive Experience**: Custom cursor, glassmorphism UI, and spatial interactions

## Scenes

1. **The Nexus**: Upload images by interacting with a pulsating 3D node
2. **The Workshop**: Edit your image with orbital satellite controls
3. **The Export**: Download your watermarked creation with shimmer effects

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Run Locally

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser to the provided local URL (typically http://localhost:3000)

## Usage

1. Click the pulsating node in the center to upload an image
2. Watch as particles coalesce to form your image
3. Use the floating UI controls to add and customize your watermark
4. Download your final watermarked image
5. The scene will reset for your next creation

## Technologies

- **Three.js**: 3D rendering and WebGL scene management
- **GSAP**: High-performance animations and transitions
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool

## Browser Support

Modern browsers with WebGL support required.
